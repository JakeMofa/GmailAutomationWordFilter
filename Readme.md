# Gmail Rejection & Interview Labeler

## Why This Project?
Are you tired of digging through countless rejection emails or trying to manually set up Gmail filters that never quite work?

I built this script to automatically label job rejections and interview invitations ‚Äî making it easier to focus only on the emails that matter. Instead of relying on Gmail‚Äôs basic filters, this tool uses regex, keyword matching, and the Gmail API to scan and label your inbox with precision.

Given how tough the job market is, I thought I‚Äôd contribute something small but useful to the community. This is my first release, based on initial testing ‚Äî but I plan to expand this open-source project with more features, better modularization, and additional automation tools over time.

Stay tuned ‚Äî and feel free to contribute, fork, or follow along.
